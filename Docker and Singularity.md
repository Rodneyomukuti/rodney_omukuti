# Docker

## Introduction 

Docker is an open source containerization platform that enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

**Publish your container in the Docker Hub to share it with other people using the following steps**

### 1. Create an account 
Create an account in the [Docker website](https://www.google.com/search?q=hub.docker.com+web+site&oq=hub.docker.com+web+site&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i13i30.1020j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Then from your shell terminal run the following command, entering the user name and password you specified registering in the Hub:

`docker login`

### 2. Tag the image with your Docker user name account:

`docker tag my-image rodney/my-image`

### 3. Push it to the Docker Hub:

`docker push rodney/my-image`

After that anyone will be able to download it for their own use

# Running nextflow from GitHub

Nextflow allows the execution of a pipeline project directly from a GitHub repository for easier sharing.

You can run a project by specifying the project name as shown below, by running the command:

`nextflow run nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf -with-docker`

Which automatically downloads the container and stores it in the `HOME/.nextflow folder`.

To check the project information, run the following command:

`nextflow info nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf`

Nextflow allows the execution of a specific revision of your project by using the -r command line option:

`nextflow run nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf -r dev`

Revision are defined by using Git tags or branches defined in the project repository.This allows a precise control of the changes in your project files and dependencies over time.

# Singularity

Singularity is container runtime designed to work in HPC data center, where the usage of Docker is generally not allowed due to security constraints.

## Creating singularity images

### 1. Create a singularity file
```
Bootstrap: docker
From: debian:stretch-slim

%environment
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/games/

%labels
AUTHOR <your name>

%post

apt-get update && apt-get install -y locales-all curl cowsay
curl -sSL https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/download/v1.0.0/salmon-1.0.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz \
 && mv /salmon-*/bin/* /usr/bin/ \
 && mv /salmon-*/lib/* /usr/lib/
 ```
 ### 2. Create an image from the file
 
 `sudo singularity build my-image.sif Singularity`
 
 ## Run the container
 
 `singularity exec my-image.sif cowsay 'Hello Singularity'`
 
 ## Start working in the container
 
 `singularity shell my-image.sif`
 `touch hello.txt
   ls -la`
   
  ## Import a Docker Image
  
  `singularity pull docker://debian:stretch-slim`
  
  ## Run a nextflow script using a singularity container
  
  `nextflow run script7.nf -with-singularity nextflow/rnaseq-nf`
