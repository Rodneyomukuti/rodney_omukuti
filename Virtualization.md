## Introduction

Virtualization is a process that allows for more efficient utilization of physical computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing. Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.

## Benefits of virtualization

Virtualization brings several benefits to data center operators and service providers:

- Resource efficiency
- Easier management
- Minimal downtime
- Faster provisioning

## Types of virtualization
- Desktop virtualization
- Network Virtualization
- Storage Virtualization
- Application virtualization
- Data center virtualization
- CPU virtualization
- GPU virtualization
- Linux Virtualization
- Cloud virtualization

## Virtualization vs. containerization

Server virtualization reproduces an entire computer in hardware, which then runs an entire OS. The OS runs one application. That’s more efficient than no virtualization at all, but it still duplicates unnecessary code and services for each application you want to run.

Containers take an alternative approach. They share an underlying OS kernel, only running the application and the things it depends on, like software libraries and environment variables. This makes containers smaller and faster to deploy.
