### Question 4
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
tuple() method can convert list to tuple


### Question 9
Level 2

Question£º
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


### Question 14
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


### Question 26:
Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

Hints:
Define a function with two numbers as arguments. You can compute the sum in the function and return the value.

### Question 27
Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.

Hints:

Use str() to convert a number to string.


### Question 29
Define a function that can receive two integral numbers in string form and compute their sum and then print it in console.

Hints:

Use int() to convert a string to integer.


### Question 32
Define a function that can accept an integer number as input and print the "It is an even number" if the number is even, otherwise print "It is an odd number".

Hints:

Use % operator to check if a number is even or odd.


### Question 35
Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the values only.

Hints:

Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
Use ** operator to get power of a number.
Use range() for loops.
Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.


### Question 46
Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of elements in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints
Use map() to generate a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

### Question 47
Write a program which can map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are square of even number in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints
Use map() to generate a list.
Use filter() to filter elements of a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.
